Iâ€™m a Software Engineer passionate about Bitcoin & Lightning âš¡ (running a full node to support the network) + Ethereum (been doing a bit of Solidity development and security auditing).

My background is being a Java/.NET backend engineer, but nowadays I just hack stuff through bash and golang. Looking to learn a bit of rust.
If there was a chance I'd use Haskell / ELM (or at least Scala) for greenfield development.

Working in the DevSecOps field (I have experience with configuration management through Puppet) but I prefer [Nix](https://nixos.org/) whenever possible. I've set-up a few Kubernetes clusters the hard way before the publication of [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) :) Participating in CTFs when I have time.

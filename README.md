### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gregor. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer passionate about Bitcoin & Lightning âš¡ (running a full node to support the network).

My background is being a [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)/.NET Backend Engineer, but nowadays I just hack stuff in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Golang](https://golang.org) and (lots of) [YAML](https://noyaml.com) :)

Working in the DevSecOps field (I have experience with configuration management through [Puppet](https://puppet.com) and [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)) but I prefer [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) whenever possible. I've set-up a few [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters the hard way before the publication of [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). Interested in cyber security and exploiting low-level vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, double frees etc.
